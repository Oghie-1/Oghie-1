            I am a solution-driven product manager with a passion for sustainability and a diverse set of skills that includes project management, entrepreneurship, research, operations, and sales. I am currently a graduate student of renewable energy and sustainable technology at USW and an experienced project/product operations manager with three years of experience.

I am committed to making a positive impact on the world through my work and my focus on sustainability. Having been a Google Africa Developer and a recipient of the ALX scholarship, I am deeply passionate about using technology to drive positive change and create a better future for our planet.

As a product manager, I thrive in a fast-paced and collaborative environment. I have a proven track record of creating value early, developing a balanced product strategy, and ensuring that agreed-upon objectives and goals are met. My approach is customer-centric, and I seek to understand and address their pain points while also meeting the needs of the business.

I have experience working in complex environments and managing cross-functional teams to deliver successful products. I believe that collaboration and communication are key to achieving success, and I work tirelessly to ensure that everyone involved in a project is aligned and working towards the same goals.

I am currently seeking a challenging and rewarding product manager position where I can leverage my experience in product development and management to drive growth and success for the organization. I am excited about the opportunity to work on sustainable projects that align with my values and passion, and to use my skills and experience to make a positive impact on the world.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my Git profile, and I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate and make a difference together.</p></div>
